## About Me

###### Hi there! My name is Joshua, a self-taught coder with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning new things. I specialize in building dynamic web applications using a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node, Ejs, MySQL, and PHP.

With my blue-collar background, I bring a unique perspective to my coding and a commitment to getting the job done right. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and learn the latest techniques to improve my skills.

Some of my recent projects are linked below.

If you're looking for a developer with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning, you've come to the right place. Let's connect and see how I can help bring your ideas to life!
